# Contributing to Our Project

We welcome all contributions so want to make this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact us if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sudo-zach/PaperProton-Redux/issues); it's that easy!

We'd request that you detail bug reports with detail, background and sample code. Feel free to follow our Issue Template as a guide, however if you are using a blank template. Your report typically should include:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Thanks!
